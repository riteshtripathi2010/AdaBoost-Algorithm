# AdaBoost-Algorithm
I have used Kaggle's Mushroom csv data, which can be downloaded easily. 
I have used this particular algorithm to get the best feature amonng numerous features available in the dataset, as we are aware that the tree based methods have greater capabilities to report feature importance
ADaboost has stumps, focusing on one feature at a time
